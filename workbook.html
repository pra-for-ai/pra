            <p>The PRA for AI workbook is a tool for conducting probabilistic risk assessments of AI systems. It offers an integrated environment for assessing potential risks from AI systems, including all reference objects and protocols for selecting assessment complexity, executing the assessment, and generating a final risk report card.</p>
            <p>The current version of the workbook is 0.9, representing a working beta, and will be released on this page in early Q4 2024. This version includes structured support for scanning potential risks through a Taxonomy of Aspect-Oriented AI Hazards, extensive guidance on generating risk scenarios and estimating levels of risk, and detailed instructions on systematically documenting each step of the process. At the conclusion, users receive an auto-generated risk Report Card summarizing their findings.</p>
            <p>The development team is actively seeking user feedback to enhance and streamline the assessment workflow.</p>
